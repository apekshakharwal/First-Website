        <h3>WHAT IS CODING?</h3>
        <p>Coding is the process of transforming ideas, solutions, and instructions into the language that the computer can understand  that is, binary-machine code.Coding involves  communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to perform using a computer programming language. </p>  
   
        <h3>HOW CODING WORKS?</h3>
        <p>The short answer is that writing code tells the computer what to do, but it’s not quite that simple. A computer can only understand two distinct types of data: on and off. In fact, a computer is really just a collection of on/off switches (transistors). Anything that a computer can do is nothing more than a unique combination of some transistors turned on and some transistors turned off.  </p>
   
   <h4>PROGRAMMING LANGAUGES</h4>
   
   <ul>The 4 types of Programming Language that are classified are:
   <li >Procedural Programming Language</li>
   <li >Functional Programming Language</li>
   <li>Scripting Programming Language</li>
   <li >Logic Programming Language</li>
   <li >Object-Oriented Programming Language</li></ul>

                  <p>HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the standard way of coding web pages to showcase electronic information. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is used to format the content, pictures, and videos featured online. HTML tells the internet browser how to display websites for an optimal user experience.</p>

                    <p>CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style. Developed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS tells internet browsers each page’s layout, background color, font size, cursor shape, and more. Crafting and maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.</p>

                    <p>C Language is a simple, low-level coding type initiated in 1972 by Bell Labs to build the UNIX system. Perhaps the easiest language, C has just 32 basic keywords used for scripting embedded systems, network drivers, and artificial intelligence. C language is versatile to get computer hardware communicating.</p>

Released in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ organizes and stores info in bundles for more complex programs. Adobe, Microsoft Office and Amazon utilizes C++ for fast processing.</p>
